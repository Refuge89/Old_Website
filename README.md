## Introduction

My friend is into 'nulling' websites, later on gave the files to me. 
Then I decided to turn it into WoW registration site.

## Install

Installation is pretty easy, copy all the files into your 'htdocs' or 'www' folder. 
After doing that, head over to the \account\register\include\config.php to match the settings with your auth database.

Want a forum? Paste your phpbb, mybb, vbulletin or something else into the \forum folder. I advice using mybb!


OPTIONAL: I've added a counter to the site, to make this somewhat work execute the .SQL in the \sql folder.

## Updates

I may release a few tweaks, keep an eye on the commits.
